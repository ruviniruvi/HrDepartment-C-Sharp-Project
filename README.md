# HrDepartment-C-Sharp-Project


## Project Description :

For this project I designed and developed software WCF service application that provides useful business logics and functions as middleware objects.

I developed this program using Microsoft Visual Studio C# development tool.
The software WCF service application have documented and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio C#  Web GUI .

This project is based on database which called “hr_department database” . 
I implemented a web application to display all the employee details from the hr_department database as a first part of the project. 
I have used Visual Studio C# as a language to implement WCF service and the web application to test the WCF service.
